  If I needed to choose only one programming language to master, Javascript would be my choice. With Javascript we are able to create everything from web applications, mobile apps, and server-side applications, even desktop applications using Electron.js. I think this should convince you to learn Javascript! In order to get started with Javascript you should know some of its history - that's what this blog is for.
At the time I write this blog post, Javascript is on version 😍ES2020 (ES11)😍 already (ES is short for EcmaScript, the technical name for Javascript).

### A brief overview of what is new in all ES versions:

### ES2015 (ES6)

In 2015, Javascript was back in the game after it had been ignored by most serious programmers (see the [**Why is Javascript bad?** discussion on quora](https://www.quora.com/Is-JavaScript-really-a-bad-language)).
2015 was the golden year of Javascript and had its biggest update of all time.

These are the main updates of ES2015:
- Let/Const Variable Declaration
- Arrow Functions
- Classes
- Modules (import/export)
- Template Strings
- Default function parameters
- Rest/Spread Operators
- Array/Object Destructuring
- Promises
- Iterators and Generators

#### Let/Const

`let` and `const` variable declarations were introduced. It is highly recommended to use them over `var` to be explicit about the nature of the variable.

```jsx 
let message = 'hello';
message = 'good bye'; // works just fine because let declares variables that can be altered
```
```jsx
const message = 'hello';
message ='good bye'; // returns an error because the value of the Constant message cannot be changed
```

#### Arrow functions

With the old way, we would write functions as below:
```jsx
function sum(value1, value2){
    return value1 + value2;
}
```
But with arrow function we can write in a compressed way, like this:

```jsx
const sum = (value1, value2)=>{
    return value1 + value2;
}
```
The arrow syntax `()=>{}` creates a function and the constant `sum` is declared to store it. This is also an example of an `anonymous function` because it has no explicit name, but is immediately assigned to a variable.

We can use an even more simple syntax if the operation we are performing immediately returns a value:

```jsx
const sum = (value1, value2) => value1 + value2
```

#### Classes

In ES6 we are able to write Javascript in with Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

For example, we create new class called `Calculator` (convention encourages the use of a capital letter when creating a class, but it isn't required). The Calculator class constructor is called whenever the `new` keyword is used to make an instance of the class, and expects one parameter called `moneyBeforeDiscount`.
```jsx
class Calculator{
    constructor(moneyBeforeDiscount){
        this.moneyBeforeDiscount = moneyBeforeDiscount;
    }
    moneyAfterDiscount(discountRate){
        return this.moneyBeforeDiscount * (100-discountRate)/100;
    }
}
```

We instantiate the `Calculator` class to a variable called `bill` and call one of its method to print out the total after discount.
```jsx
const bill = new Calculator(5000);
console.log('Total after discount :' + bill.moneyAfterDiscount(5));
```

We can also use class inheritance with the keyword `extend` and reference back to parent class with the keyword `super`.
```jsx
class MoreCalculate extend Calculator{
    constructor(moneyBeforeDiscount,discountRate,moneyExchange){
        super(moneyBeforeDiscount);
        this.moneyExchange = moneyExchange;
        this.discountRate = discountRate;
    }

    moneyAfterExchange(){
        return this.moneyAfterDiscount(this.discountRate)/this.moneyExchange;
    }
}
```

#### Modules (import/export)

Before ES6, Javascript didn't support module management natively. In ES6 though, we can `export` functions and variables from a file, and then `import` those elements in a different file.

```jsx
// calculator.js
const add = (a, b) => a + b
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b

export { add, multiply }
```

```jsx
// App.js
import { add } from './calculator'

console.log(add(2, 3)); //5
```

#### Template Strings

Declaring strings is often done on one line using either single quotes `'` or double quotes `"`. The backtick character \` allows us to create template strings and replace repetative `+` string operations to concatenate regular strings and variables as well as allow multiline string variables. In order to interpolate variables inline just wrap the variable name in `${}`:

```jsx
const sum = 2+5;
console.log(`2 + 5 = ${sum}`);

//normal method
console.log('2 + 5 ='+ sum);
```

You can also call functions and perform operations inside the template wrapper:
```jsx
const message = 'khmer  coder';
console.log(`good morning, ${message} and ${2+2}`);
//good morning, khmer coder and 4;
```
#### Default function parameter values

ES6 also includes the ability to set a default parameter value which allows developers to set a fallback value if a function is called without necessary parameters.

```jsx
const greeting = (name, message = 'Hello') => console.log(`${message}, ${name}`);
greeting('Sambat'); // "Hello, Sambat"
greeting('khmer coder','Hi'); // "Hi, khmer coder"
```

#### Rest/Spread Operators

The Rest Operator (*not related to REST API models*) is used when there is an unknown or unlimited number of parameters in calling a function. By declaring `...` before a variable name in a function definition it will create an iterable variable of any length:

```jsx
function add(...numbers) {
  sum = 0
  for(const n of numbers) {
    sum += n
  }
  return sum
}

console.log(add(1, 2, 3)) // 6
```

The Spread Operator is used to "spread out" an array by returning the individual values in order by entering `...` before a variable. One use of this is to insert one array into the center of another, like:

```jsx
const a = [4, 5, 6]
const b = [1, 2, 3, ...a, 7] // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

#### Array/Object Destructuring

Array and Object Destructuring are used when we want to assign the value of variables from somewhere in an array or object directly. When destructuring, the variables on the left of the assignment operator are updated but the  Array or Object is left unchanged.

Array destructuring uses the order of the array to return a value and assigns it to the variable in the same position on the left side of the assignment operator.

```jsx
const studentScore = [50, 25, 79]
const [first, second] = studentScore

console.log(first, second) // 50, 25
```

Object destructuring matches the variable names matched to the Object's properties to perform the assignment.

```jsx
const studentA = {
  name: 'A',
  score: 99
}

const { name, score } = studentA
console.log(`${name}: ${score}`) // A: 99
```

#### Promises

Promises are widely used in asynchronous programming to handle HTTP requests and other long running processes. Promises return a result with to a function declared with the `.then` method, and `.then`s can be chained to perform multiple process steps. Error handling is done with the `.catch` method calling its own function. All Promise handler functions can be declared anonymously inline.

```jsx
url = 'https://api.github.com/search/users?q=sambatlim'

fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(result => {
    console.log(result)
  })

```

#### Iterators and Generators

Iterators:<br/>
ES6 provided the new looping syntax `for x of y`, which is similar to `foreach` in most programming languages.
```jsx
let arr= [a,b,c];
for(let value of arr){
  console.log(value);
}
//output: a, b, c
```
Generators:<br/>
Generators can return (`yield`) multiple values, one after another, on demand. They work great with Iterators.
To create the generator we need the special syntax construct: `function*` to explicity declare a normal function a generator.
To get a value we need to use the generator method `next()`. `next()` will always return an Object with two properties:
* `value`: the value that is `yield`ed or `return`ed
* `done`: `true` if the function code has finished, otherwise `false`

When It reached the `return` statement, the function will finish and return `done`:`true`. 

```jsx
function* generateSequence() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  return 3;
}

let generator = generateSequence();

let one = generator.next();
console.log(JSON.stringify(one));
//output: {value: 1, done: false}

let two = generator.next();
console.log(JSON.stringify(two));
//output: {value: 2, done: false}

let three = generator.next();
console.log(JSON.stringify(three));
//output: {value: 3, done: true}
//function has finished because it reached the return statement.
```

### ES2016 (ES7)

ES2016 introduced the minor update from the ES6 such as the Array method `.includes()` to check for the presence of a value, and an exponential operator `**`.

#### Array.includes()
```jsx
const number = [1,2,3]
console.log(number.includes(1)); //true
console.log(number.includes(7)); //false
```

#### Exponential Operator (`**`)

```jsx
console.log(2 ** 3) // 8
```

---

### ES2017 (ES8)

ES8 helps us to write the asynchronous functions in a more convenient way by introducing the keywords `async/await`. We can use these to avoid callback hell (a chain of dependant callback functions that can be very hard to debug) and improves the readability of Promises.

#### Async Functions (async/await)

With ES6 Promise handling we would write

```jsx
fetch('https://api.github.com/search/users?q=sambatlim')
  .then(response => {
    // callback 1
    response.json()
  )
  .then(result => {
    // callback 2
    console.log(result)
  })
```

With ES2017 we can declare an overall function as `async`, and then explicilty use `await` within it to resolve Promise values without blocking the whole Javascript runtime, but maintaining the normal way to write and read a Javascript function.

```jsx
async function getgithubprofile(){
    const response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/search/users?q=sambatlim') // response isn't assigned until fetch returns
    const result = await response.json() // result is not assigned until response is declared and json() returns a value
    console.log(result)
}
```

### ES2018 (ES9)

In this update, ES2018 introduced nothing new but increased the ability of the Rest and Spread Operators (`...`) that were introduced in ES6. Again, the original Object is unaltered.

#### Rest Operator for Objects

Now we can use rest on the properties of an Object. It allows us to explicitly extract certain named variables, and assign any uncalled variables into a catchall Object.

```jsx
const options = {
  enabled: true,
  text: 'Hello',
  color: 'red'
}
const { enabled, ...others } = options

console.log(enabled) // true
console.log(others)  // { text: 'Hello', color: 'red' }
```
#### Spread Operator for Objects

Using the spread operator during an Object declaration will assign the properties of the referenced Object to the new Object.

```jsx
const moreOptions = {
  text: 'Hello',
  color: 'red'
}
const options = { enabled: true, ...moreOptions }

console.log(options) // { enabled: true, text: 'Hello', color: 'red' }
```

### ES2019 (ES10)

An update for developer convience allows the use of `try/catch` without an explicit `e` Error reference in the `catch` call.

```jsx
// Before
try {
  fetch('https://example.com')
} catch (e) {
  console.log(`e`)
}
```
```jsx
// After
try {
  fetch('https://example.com')
} catch {
  console.log(`something wrong.`)
}
```

### 🔥ES2020 (ES11)

ES2020 introduced:

- Dynamic Import
- BigInt
- Nullish Coalescing Operator(`??`)
- Optional Chaining (`?.`)

#### Dynamic Import

In ES6 when we want to import references we need to write `import` at the beginning of the file. This is a static import and it cannot be conditional.
With dynamic imports we can easily assign what modules we need to import on demand, which is very useful for big applications that can have a lot of modules.

```jsx
let stageId = 'A'
let stage

if (stageId === 'A') {
  stage = await import('./stages/A')
} else {
  stage = await import('./stages/B')
}

stage.run()
```

read more at: [v8.dev](https://v8.dev/features/dynamic-import).

#### BigInt

BigInt is a Javascript data type that can store numbers larger than 2<sup>53</sup> - 1. To create a BigInt you append an `n` to the actual number.

```jsx
const big = 123456789n
```

or convert to a BigInt by calling `BigInt(yourNumber)`.

```jsx
const alsoBig = BigInt(20)
```

**Warning**: The operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` can only be used on combinations of BigInt variables.

#### Nullish Coalescing Operator (??)

Before introducing you to the Nullish Coalescing Operator, lets talk about the way you write code to check for `null` or `undefined` values. If we wanted to check the value of `score` for example, you would usually write:

```jsx
let score = null

console.log(score || 'No score')  //this code will print 'No score'
```

The problem with this is it will check not only for undeclared values like `null` or `undefined`, but for **"falsy"** values like Boolean `false`, `0`, `""` (empty string), or `NaN` (Not a Number) and treat them as empty values as well:
```jsx
let score = 0

console.log(score || 'No score')  // this will print 'No score' instead of 0;
```

The introduction of the nullish coalescing operator `??` has come to help! It will evaluate the left hand argument strictly for `null` or `undefined`, allowing "falsy" values to be returned.
```jsx
let score = 0

console.log(score ?? 'No score') //will print 0;
```

#### Optional Chaining (?.)

Let's imagine you have an Object nested within another Object:

```jsx
    const student ={
        profile:{
            school:{
                name:'RUPP'
            }
        }
    }
```
If you want to get the `name` property of the `student`'s `school` property, you would normally use `student.profile.school.name`. But what if `student.profile` hasn't been declared? You would get an error:
```jsx
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'school' of undefined
```
So to prevent that error you could add an IF statement that checked for the existence of `student.profile` before trying to reference its properties, so that it returns before erroring out if `profile` is undefined:
```jsx
if(student.profile && student.profile.school.name) {
  return student.profile.school.name;
}
```
But that is long, and you should really check each level of property. Using the optional chaining syntax `?.` on the `profile` property you can write the equivalent line:
```jsx
student.profile?.school.name
```
This will prevent the error caused by an undeclared Object property.
